The Common Lisp source code for version 1.2 of the Xerox
part-of-speech tagger is available for anonymous FTP from
parcftp.xerox.com in the file pub/tagger/tagger-1-2.tar.Z.

This code has been tested in the following CL implementations:
 . Franz Allegro Common Lisp version 4.2 on SunOS 4.x and 5.x;
 . CMU Common Lisp version 17e on SunOS 4.x; and
 . Macintosh Common Lisp 2.0p2.

The file pub/tagger/anlp92.ps is a postscript rendering of a paper
presented at Applied Natural Language Processing'92 that describes the
design of the system.

Enjoy.
